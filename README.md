The project consists of the following:<br>
1- <b>Index page</b> with an input form and an output Paragraph area. <br>
2- <b>PHP service</b> to perform a simple call select statement and return data if existed.<br>
3- <b>SQL database</b> where records are saved.<br><br>

The service calls back <b>albums</b> based on the <b>artist name.</b> The fetch request scan the database for records that matches the request query. Once data are fetched, they're passed into the <ul>innerHTML</ul> to be displayed accordingly. <ul>NO Bootstrap styling was used</ul>; only simple highlights for the input and output sections were done.
